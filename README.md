Overview

This repository contains Python scrupts for encrypting and decrypting files using the cryptography library.
The Encryption script encrypts all files excluding certain system and critical windows directories, and
the decryption script, decrypts the files using a previously generated key (TheKey.key)

Before running the script be sure to have a backup of your data to prevent loss in case something goes wrong.
